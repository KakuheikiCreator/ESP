# Alarm
This is the firmware for an intrusion detector.
It is created using Bluetooth LE's message sending and receiving function.
It also uses the nano toolkit framework as a component.

# Background of the system development
Japan is said to have good public safety, but in reality 
it is just a surveillance society with little privacy.

And many people self-deprecatingly say that it is a 
colony-like country with no change of government.

This social problem is a major reason why 
I decided to develop this system.

I had a former secretary to a minister who had been 
politically active for a long time.

It was a complete coincidence, and I was not involved in political 
activities or belonged to any particular political organization.

However, just because I had someone politically active close to me, 
I was monitored by the media and police, my house was constantly bugged, 
and I lived a life where the door was unlocked when I returned home 
several times a year.

Moreover, I had a strong suspicion that something had been mixed into the 
food and drinks I had in my house for quite some time.

In other words, I was a victim of crime by the ruling class and 
anti-social forces in the public and private sectors, including the 
political party of the former secretary to the minister who was close to me.

I can't go into detail about how this happened, but to conclude, after 
I entered the workforce, I had a detective investigate the room next door 
and the floors above and below where they were eavesdropping.

The people in the room next door were local juvenile delinquents and people 
from a police-related organization that was involved in crime prevention 
activities, and the renter of the room next door on the opposite side was a 
member of the media.

The room was constantly transmitting mobile phone signals, and they were 
using modified mobile phones to eavesdrop on my room from the 
next room on a daily basis.

That's how they monitored ordinary citizens like me, making comments that 
mocked my private life and using it as material for TV shows.

In fact, it turned out that the room next door was rented by someone from a 
production company that produces bad-tempered TV shows that mock my private life.

It turned out to be a fairly large TV production company in Tokyo.

Moreover, on the same day that I contacted the detective from outside to 
request an investigation, they contacted a real estate agency, 
and moved and fled the same day.

Japanese people move three to four times in their lifetime.

And the reality is that the TV industry has less than 10,000 people.

In other words, if you request an investigation into the tenant of a 
certain room one day, and find that the person in question is someone 
in the TV industry, the chances of them moving out on that day are 
less than 1/6, which is lower than the chance of buying a single 
lottery ticket and winning first prize, so there's no way it could be a coincidence.

Naturally, after this was discovered, the police, media, and political 
and financial circles would hold a grudge against me, and I would never 
have had drugs mixed into my drugs at a client's place, or tested 
positive for drugs at the hospital I went to.

I, my family, and the people around me have all suffered similar abuse.

With this background, developing this system was inevitable for me.

as well as part of the investigation report and medical certificate from when 
the media I mentioned in the development history were discovered.
